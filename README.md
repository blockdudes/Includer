# Includer - Web3 Banking System

Welcome to Includer! This repository contains the source code for Includer, a Web3 banking platform built on the Stellar blockchain to provide accessible and secure financial services. The project aims to promote financial inclusion, particularly in underserved regions like the Global South, with a focus on rural areas and households headed by women.

## Project Overview

Includer leverages Stellarâ€™s blockchain infrastructure and integrates with MoneyGram to deliver a decentralized banking system that allows users to:
- Deposit fiat currency, converted into stablecoins for inflation-protected savings.
- Borrow and lend money directly on the platform.
- Transfer money to other users instantly.
- Securely manage private keys without requiring users to handle Web3 complexities.
- Withdraw funds through MoneyGram, converting stablecoins back to fiat.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Web3 Interface:** Simplified onboarding and account management without the need for private key management.
- **Fiat to Stablecoin Conversion:** Protect savings from inflation by converting fiat deposits into stablecoins.
- **Lending and Borrowing:** Earn interest by lending stablecoins or borrow against deposited assets.
- **Seamless Money Transfers:** Transfer funds to other users easily within the platform.
- **Integration with MoneyGram:** Cash deposits and withdrawals are available through MoneyGram's network.
